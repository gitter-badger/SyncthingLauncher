# SyncthingLauncher

### What is this?
A simple app to launch Syncthing.

### What version of Syncthing is this?
The latest version for Mac, 0.12.22. This'll be updated for later versions of Syncthing as soon as I can update it. 

### Is this app compatible with X version of Mac OS X?
This app is compatible with OS X 10.9 and above. Try it on 10.8, I'm not sure about 10.8. For 10.7 and below go to [this release.](https://github.com/ili-codes/SyncthingLauncher/releases/tag/OLDMACS)

### How do I add it to Startup Items?
Go to [this release.](https://github.com/ili-codes/SyncthingLauncher/releases/tag/NOADMIN_NOGUI)

### It says "This app is damaged and can't be opened." or something like that. What? Can I trust this?
Yes, you can. I don't have a Codesigning identity so Apple warns you.

   Double-click the app as normal, open it once, and then you can switch back to whatever setting you had before.

And that's it!
