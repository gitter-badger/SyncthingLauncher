# SyncthingLauncher

### What is this?
A simple app to launch Syncthing.

### What version of Syncthing is this?
The latest version for Mac, 0.12.22. This'll be updated for later versions of Syncthing as soon as I can update it. 

### Is this app compatible with X version of Mac OS X?
This app is compatible with OS X 10.9 and above. Try it on 10.8, I'm not sure about 10.8. For 10.7 and below the folder "OLD_MAC_OS" has the files you need.
